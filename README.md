# PlantSingleCellAnalysis
Analysis pipeline for plant single cell data

This github accompanies the book chapter "Development and application of scRNA-seq in Arabidopsis root using 10X-genomics based technology" (Methods. Mol. Biol., XXX?).
Here, we will show the analysis steps that we use to process a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, starting from a cellranger count matrix and ending with a Seurat object.
